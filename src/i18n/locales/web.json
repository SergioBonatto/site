  "about.imageAlt": "俺、朝日の下でJotaroへ歩む (Training beneath digital sunrise)",
  "about.paragraph1": "Code wa ore no 密技 (himitsu waza). Each line, a strike of pure resolve slicing through the darkness of bugs.",
  "about.paragraph2": "Self-taught ronin of syntax. Faced countless stack monsters and rose again. From 無 (mu) to lambda master, I shaped systems where logic meets faith. Functional programming wa ore no 剣 (ken) against chaos.",
  "about.paragraph3": "My creed stands on 基本原理 (kihon genri): presuppositional logic, praxeology, and 改革神学 (kaikaku shingaku). Not mere words. This is my senjutsu of clarity. When I debug, I see 真理 (shinri) itself. Contradictions vanish. ୧༼ಠ益ಠ༽୨ Borrowed thoughts perish. ",
  "about.paragraph4": "Every design is a battle kata. Decentralization means 自由 (jiyuu). Strong types mean 修練 (shūren). Formal verification is my rebellion against 'maybe safe'. When it compiles, harmony is restored.",
  "about.paragraph5": "I forge systems to endure beyond hype empires. Tools must obey man, not enslave him. My path rejects 便利 (benri), embraces 深淵 (shin'en). True devs own their code. No corporation, no mercy.",
  "about.paragraph6": "I drift across DeFi, logic, and 哲学 (tetsugaku). Writing scrolls about technology, faith, and the eternal struggle between man and his own abstraction.",
