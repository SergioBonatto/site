We're excited to share the detailed results of tests performed on Agoriz's core, the PaymentProcessor smart contract. This analysis reveals the robustness, security and efficiency of our solution for decentralized payments, demonstrating the protocol's potential through real data and comprehensive testing.

## Why test so thoroughly?

In a world where the cost and security of blockchain operations can be barriers to adoption, we built the PaymentProcessor with three clear objectives:

**Security and consistency**, ensuring protection against common attacks, such as MEV and state manipulation.

**Efficiency**, maintaining optimized gas consumption to ensure that usage is economically viable on public networks.

**Scalability and modularity**, allowing updates and extensions without sacrificing performance or cost.

The tests performed cover all these aspects, validating not only functionality, but also real performance in environments close to what will be used in production.

## What has been developed and tested?

We built a comprehensive test suite that validates all critical aspects of the protocol:

### 1. Dynamic Fee System Implemented

-  **Volume-based fee system**: Automatically responds to traded volumes
  - Core mode: 3% (low volume) → 5% (high volume)
  - Advanced mode: 5% (low volume) → 7% (high volume)
-  **Volume threshold**: Configured for 100 ETH daily
-  **Extension compatibility**: Allows upgrade to advanced features
-  **Automatic daily reset**: Based on UTC timestamp for global consistency

### 2. Validated Security Protections

-  **MEV protection**: Limit of 3 transactions per user per block
-  **Daily volume control**: Maximum limit of 10,000 ETH to prevent abuse
-  **Commit-reveal system**: For sensitive listings with reveal delay
-  **Rigorous validations**: Prevention of state manipulation and reentrancy attacks
-  **Emergency controls**: Pause system for critical situations

### 3. Proven Gas Optimizations

We measured and optimized gas consumption for main operations:


| Operation | Gas Consumed | Applied Optimization |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Create listing** | ~116,500 gas | Custom errors, struct packing |
| **Process payment** | ~176,200 gas | Efficient modifiers, optimized validations |
| **Cancel listing** | ~33,800 gas | Early returns, storage cleanup |


**Implemented optimization techniques:**
- Custom errors instead of require strings (saving ~50 gas per error)
- Efficient struct packing (reducing storage slots)
- Modifiers with early returns
- Modular deploy (core vs extensions)

## Cost Analysis: Verified Real Data

One of the critical points tested was real operational cost. We used verified market data (July 2025) for precise projections:

**Used market data (verified):**
- POL: $0.202 (CoinGecko)
- ETH: $2.661 (CoinGecko)
- Polygon gas: 25 gwei (PolygonScan)
- Ethereum gas: 3.552 gwei (EtherScan)


| Operation | Polygon Cost | Ethereum Cost | Real Savings |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Create listing | $0.00059 | $1.10 | 99.9% |
| Process payment | $0.00089 | $1.66 | 99.9% |
| Cancel listing | $0.00017 | $0.32 | 99.9% |


### Validated Active User Scenario

**Tested scenario**: User who creates 10 listings/month, processes 7 payments, cancels 3


| Network | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Polygon** | $0.0126 | $0.15 |
| **Ethereum** | $23.60 | $283.20 |
| **Savings** | $23.59 (99.9%) | $283.05 |


**During Ethereum congestion** (150+ gwei), savings become even more dramatic, with daily costs potentially exceeding $400 for active traders.

## Proven Determinism and Predictability

Our tests validated that gas consumption is **completely deterministic**:

-  **Identical operations** = identical gas cost
-  **Predictable pattern**: First execution more expensive (initialization), subsequent ones consistent
-  **Standard EVM behavior**: Local hardhat = real networks for gas consumption
-  **Reliable projections**: Only gas prices vary between networks, not consumption

This predictability is vital for:
- User financial planning
- Development of usage strategies
- Reliable third-party integration

## Complete Results: 79/79 Tests Passed

Our comprehensive test suite successfully validated:

-  **Core functionalities**: Creation, payment and cancellation of listings
-  **Fee system**: Automatic progression based on volume
-  **Security protections**: MEV protection, volume control, rigorous validations
-  **Gas optimizations**: Modular deploy with proven savings
-  **L2 analysis**: Consistent and predictable cost advantages
-  **Determinism**: Predictable and consistent gas consumption

## Transparent Test Methodology

To ensure technical honesty, we documented our methodology:

** Test environment**: Local Hardhat (deterministic)
** Market data**: Verified in real-time via public APIs
** Cost calculations**: Based on real gas × real prices
** Disclaimers**: All limitations clearly documented


## Current Development Status

The PaymentProcessor is in an advanced development state with:

-  **Complete core**: All essential functionalities implemented
-  **Extension system**: Modularity for future upgrades
-  **Comprehensive tests**: 79 test cases covering all scenarios
-  **Optimizations**: Gas consumption optimized for economic viability
-  **Security**: Protections against known attacks implemented

## Conclusion

The Agoriz PaymentProcessor demonstrates through rigorous testing to be a robust, secure and economically viable system for decentralized payments. The metrics presented are based on real data and transparent methodology, providing confidence in the quality and potential of the solution.

**Technical Considerations:**
- Measurements performed in controlled environment with projections based on real data
- Gas and token prices fluctuate - verify current conditions at deploy
- L2 advantages remain consistent even with market variations
- Analysis represents current state without schedule commitments
